## Overview

This Puppet module installs and configures Varnish.
It also allows to manage Varnish VCL.
Tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and Oracle Linux.

The Module is based on https://github.com/maxchk/puppet-varnish
Since than to release 3.0.0

- Added support for new OS
- Dropped support outdated OS
- Moved VCL Subclasses (acl, acl_member, backend, director, probe, selector)
- Added support for varnish 6
- Added support for varnish-plus / Varnish Enterprise

Detailed Reference to all classparameters can be found in (https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-varnish/blob/master/REFERENCE.md)

### Important information

Version 2.0.0 drops support for old OS Versions (pre systemd)
Also drops support for pre Varnish 4

## Install Varnish

installs Varnish
allocates for cache 1GB (malloc)
starts it on port 80:

```puppet
class {'varnish':
  varnish_listen_port => 80,
  varnish_storage_size => '1G',
}
```

## Class varnish

Class `varnish`
Installs Varnish.
Provides access to all configuration parameters.
Controls Varnish service.
By default mounts shared memory log directory as tmpfs.

All parameters are low case replica of actual parameters passed to
the Varnish conf file, `$class_parameter -> VARNISH_PARAMETER`, i.e.

    $memlock             -> MEMLOCK
    $varnish_vcl_conf    -> VARNISH_VCL_CONF
    $varnish_listen_port -> VARNISH_LISTEN_PORT

Exceptions are:
`shmlog_dir` - location for shmlog
`shmlog_tempfs` - mounts shmlog directory as tmpfs, (default value: true)
`version` - passes to puppet type 'package', attribute 'ensure', (default value: present)

At minimum you may want to change a value for default port:
`varnish_listen_port => '80'`

For more details on parameters, check class varnish.

## Class varnish vcl

Class `varnish::vcl` manages Varnish VCL configuration.

Varnish VCL applies following restictions:
if you define an acl it must be used
if you define a probe it must be used
if you define a backend it must be used
if you define a director it must be used

Gives access to Varnish acl, probe, backend, director, etc. definitions
(see below)

### varnish selector

Definition `varnish::vcl::selector` allows to configure Varnish selector.

While `acl`, `probe`, `backend` and `director` are self-explanatory
WTF is `selector`?

You cannot define 2 or more backends/directors and not to use them.
This will result in VCL compilation failure.

Parameter `selectors` gives access to req.backend inside `vcl_recv`.
Code:

```puppet
varnish::vcl::selector { 'cluster1': condition => 'req.url ~ "^/cluster1"' }
varnish::vcl::selector { 'cluster2': condition => 'true' } # will act as backend set by else statement
```

Will result in following VCL configuration to be generated:

```VCL
if (req.url ~ "^/cluster1") {
  set req.backend = cluster1;
}
if (true) {
  set req.backend = cluster2;
}
```

For more examples see `tests/vcl_backends_probes_directors.pp`

## Usaging class varnish::vcl

Configure probes, backends, directors and selectors

```puppet
  class { 'varnish::vcl': }
```

### configure probes

```puppet
varnish::probe { 'health_check1': url => '/health_check_url1' }
varnish::probe { 'health_check2':
  window    => '8',
  timeout   => '5s',
  threshold => '3',
  interval  => '5s',
  request   => [ "GET /healthCheck2 HTTP/1.1", "Host: www.example1.com", "Connection: close" ]
}
```

### configure backends

```puppet
varnish::vcl::backend { 'srv1': host => '172.16.0.1', port => '80', probe => 'health_check1' }
varnish::vcl::backend { 'srv2': host => '172.16.0.2', port => '80', probe => 'health_check1' }
varnish::vcl::backend { 'srv3': host => '172.16.0.3', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' }
varnish::vcl::backend { 'srv4': host => '172.16.0.4', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' }
varnish::vcl::backend { 'srv5': host => '172.16.0.5', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' }
varnish::vcl::backend { 'srv6': host => '172.16.0.6', port => '80', probe => 'health_check2' }
```

### configure directors

```puppet
varnish::vcl::director { 'cluster1': backends => [ 'srv1', 'srv2' ] }
varnish::vcl::director { 'cluster2': backends => [ 'srv3', 'srv4', 'srv5', 'srv6' ] }
```

### configure selectors

```puppet
  varnish::vcl::selector { 'cluster1': condition => 'req.url ~ "^/cluster1"' }
  varnish::vcl::selector { 'cluster2': condition => 'true' } # will act as backend set by else statement
```

If modification to Varnish VCL goes further than configuring `probes`, `backends` and `directors`
parameter `template` can be used to point `varnish::vcl` class at a different template.

NOTE: If you copy existing template and modify it you will still
be able to use `probes`, `backends`, `directors` and `selectors`.

## Redefine functions in class varnish::vcl

With the module comes the basic Varnish vcl configuration file. If needed one can replace default
functions in the configuration file with own ones and/or define custom functions.
Override or custom functions specified in the array passed to `varnish::vcl` class as parameter `functions`.
The best way to do it is to use hiera. For example:

```yaml
varnish::vcl::functions:
  vcl_hash: |
    hash_data(req.url);
    if (req.http.host) {
      hash_data(req.http.host);
    } else {
      hash_data(server.ip);
    }
    return (hash);
  pipe_if_local: |
    if (client.ip ~ localnetwork) {
      return (pipe);
    }
```

There are two special cases for functions `vcl_init` and `vcl_recv`.
For Varnish version 4 in function `vcl_init` include directive for directors is always present.
For function `vcl_recv` beside the possibility to override standard function one can also add
peace of code to the begining or to the end of the function with special names `vcl_recv_prepend` and `vcl_recv_append`
For instance:

```yaml
varnish::vcl::functions:
  pipe_if_local: |
    if (client.ip ~ localnetwork) {
      return (pipe);
    }
  vcl_recv_prepend: |
    call pipe_if_local;
```

## Tests

For more examples check module tests directory.
NOTE: make sure you don't run tests on Production server.
